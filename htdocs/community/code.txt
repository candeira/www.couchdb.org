Git Mirrors
-----------

If you prefer to use [git][] as your version control system, the Apache Software
Foundation maintains a mirror at [http://git.apache.org/][asf-git]

[Committers can follow these instructions to commit via git][asf-git-committers].

If you like working on [GitHub][], here is the [GitHub Apache CouchDB
mirror][asf-github].

_Note:_ We canâ€™t accept _pull-requests_ for contributions for legal reasons. If you
are not a committer and want to contribute code, we have to ask you [open a
ticket][jira] with your patch attached. Merging your patch can happen via git though,
so if you also include a link to your repository and commit we can make use of that.
But again, it is _cruical_ that you [attach your patch to a JIRA issue first][jira].
