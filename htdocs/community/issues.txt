=========

Bug reports, enhancement requests and tasks generally go in the [JIRA
issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB).

Please make sure to search for existing issues before submitting a new one.
Also, if you're not sure whether the problem you're seeing is actually due to
a bug in CouchDB, or whether your idea for enhancement fits with the overall
vision of the project, try stirring up a discussion on the
[mailing lists](lists.html) first.
