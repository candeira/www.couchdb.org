Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free
document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. Among other
features, it provides robust, incremental replication with bi-directional
conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and indexable using a
table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as the default view
definition language.

CouchDB is written in [Erlang][], but can be easily accessed from any
environment that provides means to make HTTP requests. There are a multitude of
third-party client libraries that make this even easier for a variety of
programming languages and environments.

See the [introduction][introduction] and the
[technical overview][] for more information.
