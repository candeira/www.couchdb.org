Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free
document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. Among other
features, it provides robust, incremental replication with bi-directional
conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and indexable using a
table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as the default view
definition language.

CouchDB is written in [Erlang][], but can be easily accessed from any
environment that provides means to make HTTP requests. There are a multitude of
third-party client libraries that make this even easier for a variety of
programming languages and environments.

See the [introduction][introduction] and the
[technical overview][] for more information.

<div class="disclaimer">
  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
  <p><em>Apache CouchDB</em> is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache
  Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation
  is  required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
  that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
  stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
  incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
  stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
  endorsed by the ASF.</p>

basic concepts of CouchDB. To give it a try, download the CouchDB code from
the [Subversion repository](community/code.html) and follow the included build
instructions.

How to Get Involved
