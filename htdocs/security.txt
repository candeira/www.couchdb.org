Reporting New Security Problems with Apache CouchDB
--------------------------------------------------- 

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security
problems and denial of service attacks against Apache CouchDB.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private security mailing
list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting
undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache CouchDB and managing the process of
fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at
this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to an undisclosed
security problem in the Apache CouchDB source code will be ignored.

If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security vulnerability, please
use [the bug reporting page][jira].

Questions about:

 - how to configure CouchDB securely
 - if a vulnerability applies to your particular application
 - obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
 - availability of patches and/or new releases

should be address to the [users mailing list][lists]. Please see [the mailing lists
page][lists] for details of how to subscribe.

The private security mailing address is: security@couchdb.apache.org

Please read [how the Apache Software Foundation handles security][asf-security]
reports to know what to expect.

Note that all networked servers are subject to denial of service attacks, and we
cannot promise magic workarounds to generic problems (such as a client streaming lots
of data to your server, or re-requesting the same URL repeatedly). In general our
philosophy is to avoid any attacks which can cause the server to consume resources in
a non-linear relationship to the size of inputs.
