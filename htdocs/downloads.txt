**CAUTION** The 1.0.0 release has a data-loss bug in it's default configuration.
Please stand by and wait for the 1.0.1 release.

If you *are* running CouchDB 1.0.0 in production, here are the steps to
reconfigure CouchDB to avoid the bug. 

*It is important that you do not stop or restart the server.*

    curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_config/couchdb/delayed_commits -d'"false"'

This disables *delayed commits*, the feature that includes the bug.

Then, for each of your databases, run:

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5984/database_name/_ensure_full_commit

Verifying Releases
------------------

When downloading from a mirror please check the
[MD5](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#md5) and
[SHA](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#sha-checksum) checksums as well
as verifying the [OpenPGP](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#openpgp)
compatible signature available from the main Apache site. The
[KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/couchdb/KEYS) file contains the public keys
used for signing release. It is recommended that a [web of
trust](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#web-of-trust) is used to
confirm the identity of these keys.

You can check the OpenPGP signature with:

    gpg --verify apache-couchdb-*.tar.gz.asc

You can check the MD5 checksum with:

    md5sum --check apache-couchdb-*.tar.gz.md5

You can check the SHA checksum with:

    sha1sum --check apache-couchdb-*.tar.gz.sha
