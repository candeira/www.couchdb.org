Verifying Releases
------------------

When downloading from a mirror please check the
[MD5](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#md5) and
[SHA](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#sha-checksum) checksums as well as
verifying the [OpenPGP](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#openpgp)
compatible signature available from the main
[Apache](http://www.apache.org/) site. The
[KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/couchdb/KEYS) file contains
the public keys used for signing release. It is recommended that a
[web of trust](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#web-of-trust) is used
to confirm the identity of these keys.

[Apache Release FAQ](http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html).
